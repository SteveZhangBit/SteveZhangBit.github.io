I'm a final-year Ph.D. student in Software Engineering at the Software and Societal Systems Department (S3D) at Carnegie Mellon University. I work with Dr. Eunsuk Kang and Dr. David Garlan. My research mainly focuses on **software architecture**, **software quality**, and **formal methods**. My goal is to develop methodologies and tools to help developers systematically design and build software systems that are **safe** and **robust**.

## Projects

- Software Robustness: Engineers and developers always want to make their software systems robust. However, what we really mean about "robustness" is often vague. IEEE defines robustness as the ability of a software system to function correctly under uncertainties in the inputs, while it is unclear what the uncertainties are and how we define the correctness of the function. In this project, we aim to develop a general formal framework for defining and reasoning software robustness. Under this framework, we have developed a [tool](https://doi.org/10.1145/3368089.3409753) for computing software robustness for transition systems, and a tool for automatically robustifying a (transition) system (under review). Currently, we are also working on reasoing robustness for systems with ML components.

- [AlloyMax](https://doi.org/10.1145/3468264.3468587): [Alloy](http://alloytools.org/) is a first-order modeling language developed by MIT with SAT as its back-end solver. It is widely used in design verification and model generation. Because of the nature of SAT, using Alloy for model generation generates an arbitrary model that satisfies the constraints, which may not be helpful. AlloyMax extends Alloy with MaxSAT solving that enables it to synthesize optimal models, which not only satisfy the constraints but also optimize for certain requirements. It brings optimization capability to Alloy and allows Alloy to solve a wider range of problems.

## Bio

I received my Bachelor's degree in Computer Science at Beijing Institute of Technology. Then, I received my Master's degree in Software Engineering at Carnegie Mellon University. Now, I'm a final-year Ph.D. student at CMU, working with [Dr. Eunsuk Kang](https://eskang.github.io/) and [Dr. David Garlan](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~garlan/).
