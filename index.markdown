I'm a third-year Ph.D. student in Software Engineering at Institute for Software Research at Carnegie Mellon University. I work with Dr. Eunsuk Kang and Dr. David Garlan. My research mainly focuses on **software architecture**, **software quality**, and **formal methods**. My goal is to develop methodologies and tools to help developers to systematically design and build software systems that are **safe** and **robust**.

***I'm actively looking for a summer internship opportunity!!!***
